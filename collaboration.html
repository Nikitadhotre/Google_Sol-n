    In 2007, the National Development Council launched the National Food Security Mission. By the end of the 11th Five Year Plan (2011 – 2012), production of rice had successfully increased to the projected “10 million tons, wheat to 8 million tons and pulses to 2 million tons.” The 12th Five Year Plan was even more successful, with a target of 25 million tons of food grain from 2017 to 2020.
    
    The National Food Security Mission implemented eight strategies to accomplish its objectives. Those strategies are to:
    
    Place focus on districts with low production and significant potential

    Establish cropping system-centric inventions

    Inherit “agro-climatic zone wise planning and cluster approach for crop productivity enhancement”

    Increase focus on annual crop (pulses) production and grow them with diverse crops

    “Promote and extend improved technologies i.e., seed, integrated nutrient management (INM), integrated pest management (IPM), input use efficiency and resource conservation technologies along with the capacity building of the farmers/extension functionaries”
    “Closely monitor the flow of funds to ensure timely reach of interventions to the target beneficiaries”

     Combine multiple interventions and the goals of each district and its plans
    “Implement agencies for assessing the impact of the interventions for a result-oriented approach”

   <h3> Zero Hunger Programme</h3>

    The Zero Hunger Programme in India began in 2017 to improve agriculture, health and nutrition. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research, the Indian Council of Medical Research, the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation and the Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) created it. The program focuses on developing farm equipment, revamping the farming system, setting up genetic gardens for biofortified plants and beginning zero hunger training. In India, most farmers do not have an adequate amount of land to support their families plus the growing population. Without proper storage available, transportation and marketing places, most food goes to waste. The Zero Hunger Programme aims to:

    <center><p>Collaboration between the food industry, governments, and NGOs can bring many benefits for food security and sustainability. For example, the food industry can share its expertise, innovation, and resources with governments and NGOs to develop and implement solutions that enhance food production, reduce food waste and losses, improve food quality and safety, and promote healthy and sustainable diets. Governments and NGOs can provide the food industry with guidance, incentives, and support to align its practices and goals with the public interest and the global agenda. Collaboration can also foster trust, dialogue, and accountability among different actors and sectors.</p></center>
